\section*{Abstract}
This thesis is about optimizing the User Experience of a business application based on the \textit{JavaFX} UI toolkit. It begins with some basics of User Experience Design, Visual Design, Usability Testing and \textit{JavaFX}, including information on how the human brain recognizes and relates shapes depending on their location and assembly.\par
Following this, the current interaction concepts of the software at hand are analyzed before providing implementations to maximize user experience on various input devices. Scalability for smaller displays such as mobile devices is also taken into account.\par
The implementations are tested using modern techniques for usability testing, such as Eye Tracking Analysis, to ensure a smooth, efficient and intuitive User Experience.\par
%This thesis is about optimizing the User Experience of a business application based on the \textit{JavaFX} UI toolkit. First of all some basics about User Experience Design, Visual design, Usability Testing and \textit{JavaFX} are conveyed to the reader. To achieve this, the reader also gets an insight into how the human brain recognizes and relates shapes depending on their assembly. Starting with analyzing the existing interaction concept of the software at hand, methods to exhaust the capabilities of possible input devices are found and implemented. Afterwards the scalability is taken into account when the application is prepared for use on smaller displays like those of mobile devices. Modern techniques of usability testing, containing Eye Tracking analysis, are utilized to ensure that major issues in software usage are eliminated for the purpose of providing a smooth, efficient and intuitive User Experience.
