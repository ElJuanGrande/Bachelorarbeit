\section*{Abstract}
This thesis is about optimizing the User Experience of a business application based on the \textit{JavaFX} UI toolkit. First of all some basics about User Experience Design, Visual design, Usability Testing and \textit{JavaFX} are conveyed to the reader. To achieve this, the reader also gets an insight into how the human brain recognizes and relates shapes depending on their assembly. Starting with analyzing the existing interaction concept of the software at hand, methods to exhaust the capabilities of possible input devices are found and implemented. Afterwards the scalability is taken into account when the application is prepared for use on smaller displays like those of mobile devices. Modern techniques of usability testing, containing Eye Tracking analysis, are utilized to ensure that major issues in software usage are eliminated for the purpose of providing a smooth, efficient and intuitive User Experience.
